# Boken Engine
This is a text-based RPG engine, written by Daniel Oaks.

This engine isn't bundling files with WebPack or doing any post-processing apart from using [Compass](http://compass-style.org) to generate the CSS. Simply put, it uses native HTML-JS modules and loads each JS file that makes up the game separately. My intention is for someone to just be able to clone the repo, start a webserver on the root and get playing!

I'm not sure exactly what my plans on this are. I have an RPG in mind that I'm slowly building up along with the engine, but the intention is to allow people to without too much fuss use this for their own games too. We'll see how well that actually goes in practice!
